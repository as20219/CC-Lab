  Check our the GOAL and the RULES of this exercise at the bottom of this file.
  
  After that, follow these steps before you start coding:

  1. rename the dancer class to reflect your name (line 35).
  2. adjust line 20 to reflect your dancer's name, too.
  3. run the code and see if a square (your dancer) appears on the canvas.
  4. start coding your dancer inside the class that has been prepared for you.
  5. have fun.

/*
GOAL:
The goal is for you to write a class that produces a dancing being/creature/object/thing. In the next class, your dancer along with your peers' dancers will all dance in the same sketch that your instructor will put together. 

RULES:
For this to work you need to follow one rule: 
  - Only put relevant code into your dancer class; your dancer cannot depend on code outside of itself (like global variables or functions defined outside)
  - Your dancer must perform by means of the two essential methods: update and display. Don't add more methods that require to be called from outside (e.g. in the draw loop).
  - Your dancer will always be initialized receiving two arguments: 
    - startX (currently the horizontal center of the canvas)
    - startY (currently the vertical center of the canvas)
  beside these, please don't add more parameters into the constructor function 
  - lastly, to make sure our dancers will harmonize once on the same canvas, please don't make your dancer bigger than 200x200 pixels.
