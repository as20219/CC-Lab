                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Aminem is a species of sea anemone belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. They are related to corals and jellyfish. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>They live in the shallow tropical waters of the ocean, where they can recieve enough sunlight, attaching themselves to various objects such as rocks, coral reefs, the sea floor, etc. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Aminem have a body made up of a cylindrical column that has their mouth on top, surrounded by a ring of tentacles that sting as a self defense mechanism. The color of their body changes randomly however they are not able to change the color of their tentacles or mouth because those are its organs. The tenatcles are transparent to allow light to pass through them for photosynthesis and it helps them filter out UV radiation.</p>

                Aminems are carnivorous and can live up to one hundred years old. They reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission, where the anemone splits into two identical individuals.  They have a symbiotic relationship with algae that live within their tissues and can provide them with additional nutrients. Aminems also have the ability to regenerate lost or damaged body which is the secret to their longevity.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Similar to a flower that grows on land, Aminems need a lot of sunlight to survive. So if the position of the sun changes they will move to try to optimze the amount of sunlight they get. If you wish to feed an Aminem, press any key to drop fish near its tentacles, and it will eat it.
