    <p>Spoons deserve better treatment. When you order takeout in China, a lot of times the restaurant will provide a
      full set of utensils that includes a spoon and chopsticks or a fork, depending on the place you order from. Based
      on my personal experience, as well as asking others, I realize that the spoon is often not utilized because I
      argue that the spoon's only real purpose is for etiquette. The only thing that a spoon can do that the other
      utensils can not do is help you drink soup. Yet drinking soup with a spoon is not as efficient compared to just
      drinking out of the bowl. So I believe that spoons deserve more treatment and usage, otherwise it leads to
      wasteful situations. </p>
